This is an R Markdown document for illustrating the amount of retirement corpus that would be available by simulating returns and savings. 

First the investment horizon is assumed for a period of 30 years.

Here we see the various returns expected from a normal distributed process with mean = 8% and standard deviation = 10%

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1234)
rate<-rnorm(30,0.08,0.1)
rate<-data.frame(rate)
ggplot(rate,aes(rate))+geom_histogram()
```

Now if assume the monthly contribution to be 40000, then the annual contribution is 40000*12 = 480000

The way to calculate the final corpus is easily done using the cumprod function that R provides.

```{r}
PMT=40000*12
CORPUS<-sum(PMT*cumprod(rev(1+rate$rate)))
print(paste("The final corpus is: ",CORPUS))
```

We can also now simulate the final corpus for 1000 iterations and plot its distribution
```{r}
calc_corpus<-function()
{
  rate<-rnorm(30,0.08,0.1)
  PMT=40000*12
  CORPUS<-sum(PMT*cumprod(rev(1+rate)))
  return(CORPUS)
}

retirement_corpus<-rep(0,1000)
for (value in seq(1:1000))
{
  retirement_corpus[value]<-calc_corpus()
}

print(paste("Length of simulation is:",length(retirement_corpus)))
ggplot(data.frame(retirement_corpus),aes(retirement_corpus))+geom_histogram()

```
